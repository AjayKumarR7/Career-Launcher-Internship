# Career-Launcher-Internship

This repository contains my solutions to the problems given by Career Launcher as part of their internship program.  

The internship was for six weeks, and we have to solve one module for each week. We would be given the stock of a large or small-cap company, and I was allocated to work on the stock of Axis Bank.

As part of [Module 1](https://github.com/ajaykumarr28/Career-Launcher-Internship/blob/master/Module%201-%20Pandas.ipynb), I got to play around and familiarise myself with Pandas. Then to improve my visualization skills, [Module 2](https://github.com/ajaykumarr28/Career-Launcher-Internship/blob/master/Module%202-%20Plotting%20in%20Financial%20Markets.ipynb) concentrated on using Matplotlib and Seaborn. As the program progressed into [Module 3](https://github.com/ajaykumarr28/Career-Launcher-Internship/blob/master/Module%203%20-%20Regression%20-%20Beta%20Calculation.ipynb), I got to opportunity to explore the stocks of other companies like Asian Paints, Bharat Petroleum, Bajaj Finance, and Adani Ports. Then [Module 4](https://github.com/ajaykumarr28/Career-Launcher-Internship/blob/master/Module%204%20-%20Algo%20Trading%20using%20Classification.ipynb) is where things got real, and I got to perform algorithmic trading using classification. Then [Module 5](https://github.com/ajaykumarr28/Career-Launcher-Internship/blob/master/Module%205%20-%20Modern%20Portfolio%20Theory.ipynb) helped me to understand Modern Portfolio Theory, which helped me to a great extent with the final module, [Module 6](https://github.com/ajaykumarr28/Career-Launcher-Internship/blob/master/Module%206%20-%20Clustering%20for%20Diverse%20portfolio%20analysis.ipynb), where I had to perform clustering for diverse portfolio analysis. And to cap it off, there was a final online interview (simulated), where a series of questions were asked about how I solved each problem.

Overall, this remote internship was an invaluable experience, helping me revisit most of the concepts of data science and machine learning, and helped me productively use my free time after college.
